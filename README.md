# hx-googlecast-externs
#### Haxe/JavaScript externs for Google Cast Receiver, Sender, Game SDK.

_Targeted at Cast version v1_

# Updates
 * I'm not sure if I will maintain the extern classes. It it provides as is. Feel free to do a pull-request.

# Credits
 * Part of the type definitions are created by Mark Knol. I'm not associated with Google. It could be the case stuff is missing or the documentation is incorrect. I manually collected the Haxe extern classes and copy/pasted the documentation at it.
 * Part of the definitions are created by renaudbardet, see https://github.com/renaudbardet/google-cast-receiver-hx-headers I've put it together for convinience.
